            <h3>Tyson Files For Bankruptcy After Dang Coyote Gets Into Coop Again</h3>
            <h6>-Just in-</h6>
            <p>SPRINGDALE, AR—Unable to overcome the devastating losses it incurred as a result of that ornery critter, food processing company
                Tyson Foods filed for bankruptcy Wednesday after a got-dang coyote got into the ol’ chicken coop again. “Someone done gone an’ left
                the door open last night, and I’ll be dad-blamed if a varmint didn’t git in there and tear up all my chickens,” said CEO Donnie King, whom
                company sources described as “a feller ’bout fit to be tied,” stating that the executive had kicked his boot in the dirt, spat, and then grabbed
                his two-piper to hunt down the consarned coyote what ran off with all 250 million of Tyson’s roosters and hens, thereby forcing the company into a
                Chapter 7 filing. “Ain’t nothin’ left of our poultry operation but a pile of feathers and feed, so we gonna have to liquidate and close up shop. I
                tell you what, though, I’m gonna give that dern watchdog a good whuppin’ for falling asleep on the job and making me lose my business, that worthless
                mutt.” At press time, King vowed he would scrape together enough financing to salvage Tyson and take the company back to its roots by processing
                high-quality fresh and frozen roadkill products.</p>

            <h3>Rural America Becomes Cybernetic Metropolis After Gaining Access To High-Speed Internet</h3>
            <p>WASHINGTON—After the nation’s vast stretches of countryside were replaced almost overnight by sprawling, futuristic cityscapes, government officials confirmed
                Wednesday that programs aimed at bringing high-speed internet to underserved areas had turned rural America into a cybernetic metropolis. “As soon as they had
                modern broadband and faster download speeds, these small communities began merging into a highly advanced utopia with the most sophisticated technology on the
                planet,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, whose department oversees efforts to improve internet access in rural America and who verified reports that
                Kansas and Nebraska were now crisscrossed with a network of hover-rail lines that traversed a seemingly endless expanse of gleaming glass skyscrapers. “For years,
                we’ve talked about electronic connectivity being the key to economic development in rural areas, and indeed, most of the nation’s farming is now carried out by
                either human-machine hybrids or grain elevators that have achieved consciousness. Of course, agriculture will be obsolete once these small-town Americans have
                abandoned their bodies and uploaded their minds to a centralized grid.” Vilsack later added that most of the Corn Belt was now a single conscious entity
                called ╟♦ëσâ∞►Φ╕.</p> <!--L'ultima paraula no es un error, es com apareix a la noticia-->

            <h3>Toyota Unveils New Bitter Coating To Prevent Children From Swallowing Cars</h3>
            <p>TOYOTA, JAPAN—Noting that the colorful, shiny vehicles are far more toxic than they appear, Toyota officials announced Wednesday that the company has created a new
                bitter coating to prevent children from swallowing cars. “Thanks to this state-of-the-art denatonium benzoate coating, children will be far more deterred from
                putting entire automobiles into their mouths,” said CEO Kōji Satō, adding that, previously, it was not uncommon for an unsupervised child to find a vehicle,
                swallow it whole, and end up in the emergency room. “The truth is, even ingesting a car part like a carburetor, exhaust pipe, or gasket could quickly lead to
                sickness or even death. But now, if a child tries to eat a Corolla, Prius, or even a Highlander, they’ll immediately spit out the vehicle onto the road, where
                it belongs.” At press time, Satō added that as an extra precaution, all Toyotas would also be sold in thick childproof plastic packaging.</p>
